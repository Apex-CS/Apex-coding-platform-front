## Apex Coding Platform Front

This project is an entire platform that wants to provide an auto-training tool for practice logical solving skills. 

Also, this project is a tool for replacing the current interview tools in Apex interviews and a way to prepare for the coding challenges in Apex-Client interviews.

This front-end project tries to provide the minimal UI tools with all the necessary for a code challenge.

Main features:
* Multiple language support adding API endpoints, currently working with Java 21 and Python 3
* Real time update on multiple origins with the same URL
* Pre-loaded code challenges with test cases verification
* Time tracking
* User Actions tracking
